## Introduction

There are dozens of alpha-numerical riddles in the Pseudo Sibylline books. Major part of them are simple, only referring to the first letter of the person, and the number of that letter. For Greeks, letters happened to have a [numerical value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals) also. I'm calling this letter value substitution system with a name _isopsephy_ simply because it was a name known for the Ancient Greeks. Nowadays, this literary device is maybe a bit too much mystified and known mostly by its Hebrew counterpart _gematria_. Although isopsephy was used for divination also, one should also consider it as a device used by poets and experts in different literary genres. Those people wanted to excel in the art they practiced. Isopsephy, along with the dactylic hexameter, affected to the outer structure of the text. Both were concrete devices in the toolbox of the masters of the written text and rhetorics.

The most of the riddles in Sibylline Oracles are actually too simple to be solved by computer algorithms only. There are not enough parameters for processing, thus all the words meeting simple criteria are far too many for any sensical analysis. Take for example Sibyl Book I, verses 51-60:

    Then a great destroyer of pious men shall come, whom seven times ten shall point out clearly.
    But from him a son, whom the first letter of three hundred proves, shall take the power.
    And after him shall be a ruler, of the initial sign of four, a life-destroyer.
    Then a reverend man of the number fifty. Next, succeeding him Who has the first mark of
    the initial sign three hundred, shall a Celtic mountaineer.

In the footnotes of "The Sibylline Oracles" by Milton S. Terry, page 41 we find that _seven times ten_ refers to the letter omicron (O), which numerical value is 70. Ouespasianos ([Vespianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian)) is the person refered here, because just before the verse 51 oracle talks about the three kings Galba, Otho, and Vitelius who shortly reigned in the Roman Empire in 69AD. The next emperor in Rome was the son of the former, namely Titus, which first letter T is equal to 300 in Greek numerals. Continuation of the puzzle is made clear with the next three emperors: Domitian (_initial sign of four_ meaning simply D = 4), Nerva (_reverend man of the number fifty_, N = 50), and lastly Trajan (_initial sign three hundred_, T = 300).

Similar puzzles can be found from:

- I : 30, 388
- III : 28
- V : 18, 118, 149, 253, 274, 321, 338, 351
- VIII : 48, 88, 127, 233, 306, 321
- XII : 21, 38, 73, 122, 313

It is interesting that we can find a solution for the ealier kingdoms and emperors in the riddles, but we have somewhat lost the context on the younger riddles from 200AD to 600AD.

From the more than 800 000 words, the words starting with any of the 24 Greek letters would yield tens of thousands of hits. I don't have a categorization / morphology system for the words so that I could filter proper nouns. If there was a way to find out names from the words database, then task might be reasonable.

On the other hand, as we can see, most of these riddles conserning persons, cities, and Gods names can be taken as solved already. Context of the riddle is revealing a name behind the puzzle. It helps that the plot of each book is more or less chronologially structured. Sometimes names are already mentioned near by the riddle, like Rome in the [Riddle 3](#Riddle-3). In these samples it is obscure, why riddles were used in first hand. It is possible that texts were edited later to add more information, fulfil predictions, correct and manipulate the original ones to prove divine inspiration.

But then there are couple of other riddles very special in nature. They contain more information about letters, syllables, vowels, consonants, and the total value of the name or the title. One of them, the Riddle 1, is regarded as unsolved yet so far. [Riddle 2](#Riddle-2) is solved, but works as a good reference and check point for the first one. Riddle 3 is here for an example as a more difficult puzzle to solve programmically, nevertheless solved by contextual analysis.

I'll take these three riddles under the closer investigation in this study:
