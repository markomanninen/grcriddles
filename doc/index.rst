Alphanumeric Riddles of Ancient Greeks
======================================

In the following chapters, I'm guiding through the process of solving some
enigmatic alphanumeric riddles in the Greek `Pseudo Sibylline
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibylline_Oracles>`__ oracles.

In the first chapter, I will download and preprocess freely available open
source Greek corpora. In the second chapter, I will use the processed unique
word database to solve some specific riddles in the Sibylline oracles. The third
chapter is reserved more for the speculative analysis of the results.

The reader may download all material and code for the interactive exploration
from the GitHub project: `https://github.com/markomanninen/grcriddles
